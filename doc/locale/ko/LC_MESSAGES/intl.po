"**gettext** [1]_ is an established standard for internationalization and "
"localization.  It naively maps messages in a program to a translated "
"string. Sphinx uses these facilities to translate whole documents."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intl.rst:28
msgid ""
"Initially project maintainers have to collect all translatable strings "
"(also referred to as *messages*) to make them known to translators.  "
"Sphinx extracts these through invocation of ``sphinx-build -b gettext``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intl.rst:32
msgid ""
"Every single element in the doctree will end up in a single message which"
" results in lists being equally split into different chunks while large "
"paragraphs will remain as coarsely-grained as they were in the original "
"document.  This grants seamless document updates while still providing a "
"little bit of context for translators in free-text passages.  It is the "
"maintainer's task to split up paragraphs which are too large as there is "
"no sane automated way to do that."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intl.rst:40
msgid ""
"After Sphinx successfully ran the "
":class:`~sphinx.builders.gettext.MessageCatalogBuilder` you will find a "
"collection of ``.pot`` files in your output directory.  These are "
"**catalog templates** and contain messages in your original language "
"*only*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intl.rst:45
msgid ""
"They can be delivered to translators which will transform them to ``.po``"
" files --- so called **message catalogs** --- containing a mapping from "
"the original messages to foreign-language strings."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intl.rst:49
msgid ""
"Gettext compiles them into a binary format known as **binary catalogs** "
"through :program:`msgfmt` for efficiency reasons.  If you make these "
"files discoverable with :confval:`locale_dirs` for your "
":confval:`language`, Sphinx will pick them up automatically."

"An example: you have a document ``usage.rst`` in your Sphinx project.  "
"The gettext builder will put its messages into ``usage.pot``.  Imagine "
