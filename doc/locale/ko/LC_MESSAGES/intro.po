"This is the documentation for the Sphinx documentation builder.  Sphinx "
"is a tool that translates a set of reStructuredText_ source files into "
"various output formats, automatically producing cross-references, indices"
" etc.  That is, if you have a directory containing a bunch of reST-"
"formatted documents (and possibly subdirectories of docs in there as "
"well), Sphinx can generate a nicely-organized arrangement of HTML files "
"(in some other directory) for easy browsing and navigation.  But from the"
" same source, it can also generate a PDF file using LaTeX, `rinohtype`_ "
"or `rst2pdf`_ (see :ref:`builders`)."

"The focus is on hand-written documentation, rather than auto-generated "
"API docs. Though there is support for that kind of documentation as well "
"(which is intended to be freely mixed with hand-written content), if you "
"need pure API docs have a look at `Epydoc "
"<http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/>`_, which also understands reST."
